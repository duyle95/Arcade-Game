* Open index.html in your favorite web browser.
* The game then should run automatically.
* Use button ( up, down, left, right ) to control the character. You accumulate scores(left side) every times you move it across the water land.
* Hearts(right side) indicate how many times you can play left. Total is 4 times. If the hearts run out, the score resets to 0.
* If you collide with the bugs, the game backs to the starting point and you lose one heart.
* Have fun!!
